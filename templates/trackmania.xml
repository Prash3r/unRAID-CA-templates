  <Overview>Docker image for running a trackmania 2020 dedicated server easily. You need to forward the ports 2350 and 3450 for UDP and TCP. do NOT expose port 5000 to the internet! Also check out my PyPlanet port of harha's docker (when using PyPlanet you also need a Database - i recommend mariadb). But this container should be able to run alone and give you a vanilla tm2020 server. If you plan on running it with pyplanet you should first get this server running alone in vanilla configuration before starting with the database and pyplanet. highly recommend to put the db, pyplanet and this server on an isolated/virtual network. It should also be able to run other mania game servers, but i have not tried it. the initial installation is NOT running out of the box. you need to provide a valid cfg_server.xml inside the Config folder and a cfg_tracklist.xml config file into the Maps/MatchSettings/ folder. To make this server dedicated you need Club Access to the tm2020 game. First you should get your own dedicated server login here: https://players.trackmania.com/server/dedicated With that information. with that information you can edit the config examples you find in this zip files to your needs and copy them to the server: http://files.v04.maniaplanet.com/server/TrackmaniaServer_Latest.zip UserData/Config/cfg_server.xml belongs into the Config volume. UserData/Maps/MatchSettings/cfg_tracklist.xml belongs into the Maps/MatchSettings folder.obviously you need at least one map stored in a Maps subfolder and referenced from the cfg_tracklist.xml (with relative Path from the Maps folder) a great resource for me was this tuturial even when not fully applicable to this docker setup: https://hoerli.net/trackmania-2020-dedicated-server-pyplanet-installieren-linux/</Overview>
