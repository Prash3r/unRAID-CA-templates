  <Overview>Docker image for running a pyplanet instance for trackmania 2020 dedicated servers easily. You should already have a dedicated TrackmaniaServer running successfully in vanilla mode (try the sister container of this one) you should also have a mariadb Database instance running with persistent storage. Then you should create a database and a user with all privileges on that database. You can probably follow the database creation part of this tuturial: https://hoerli.net/trackmania-2020-dedicated-server-pyplanet-installieren-linux/ . after first start of the container you should have the pyplanet folder and the settings folder inside that created. put a valid base.yaml and apps.yaml in this settings folder also containing all the information needed for the database and the vanilla tm server including rpc-xml port and hostname. Do keep in mind that these 3 containers (including the database) need to be able to reach each other. I recommend to just give them an ip on your local network. (if that is not an option for you then you need to create a custom network and join it via the post arguments on the server container and just join it via post arguments on this container.) You should generally delay this container for some seconds. This container also uses the appdata folder of the actual server folder, keep that in mind if you want to change paths.</Overview>
